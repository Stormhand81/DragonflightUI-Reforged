# 🐉 Dragonflight UI: Reforged

Dragonflight UI: Reforged is a reforging of a proven legacy.

Born from the foundations of Dragonflight: Reloaded, this project is not a simple fork — it is a deliberate evolution. Every module, default, and visual decision has been revisited, refined, and reforged with a single goal: to deliver a Dragonflight-inspired interface worthy of Classic-era Azeroth.

This is a UI shaped by restraint, precision, and intent — where modern clarity meets the timeless soul of World of Warcraft.

## ⚔️ A UI Forged, Not Assembled

Dragonflight UI: Reforged abandons excess in favor of mastery.

Instead of overwhelming users with endless toggles, it embraces strong visual identity and sensible defaults, allowing the UI to feel complete from the very first login — powerful, cohesive, and immersive.

Customization exists where it matters.
Silence exists where it should.

<br>

## ✨ Core Philosophy

Epic clarity over clutter

Defaults that feel intentional, not generic

Modern Dragonflight aesthetics, adapted — not copied

Classic compatibility without compromise

Performance-first, always

This UI does not try to reinvent World of Warcraft.
It sharpens it.

<br>

## 🧩 Modular by Design

Every component is forged as a module:

Enable only what you need

Clean separation of features

Profile-aware configuration

Safe coexistence with other addons

Whether you seek immersion, efficiency, or both — Reforged adapts without losing its identity.

<br>

## 🐲 From Reloaded to Reforged

Dragonflight UI: Reforged stands on the shoulders of Dragonflight: Reloaded, honoring its vision while pushing it further:

Tighter visual cohesion

Smarter defaults

Reduced redundancy

Stronger first-run experience

What once was assembled is now forged.

<br>

## 🏹 Who This UI Is For

Players who value immersion and aesthetics

Classic-era veterans seeking modern clarity

Minimalists who want power without noise

Those who believe a UI should feel inevitable, not optional

<br>

## 🔌 Immersion Compatibility

Dragonflight UI: Reforged was designed to work seamlessly alongside Immersion, a minimal and intelligent UI addon focused on cinematic gameplay and visual clarity.

Both projects share the same design philosophy:
clean presentation, invisible systems, and immersion first.

When used together, Dragonflight UI: Reforged and Immersion create a unified interface experience — modern, restrained, and deeply atmospheric — without redundant elements or visual conflict.

Automatic detection when Immersion is loaded

Safe coexistence with shared UI elements

No forced overrides or duplicated logic

Immersion is developed and maintained by the same author.
